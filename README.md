# priority queue

This priority queue class is used for an imaginary patient queue at a hopsital. As each new patient checks into the hospital, the staff assesses the patietnâ€™s injuries and gives them an integer priority rating. Smaller integers represent greater urgency, for example a patient of priority 1 is more urgent should receive care before a patient of priority 2. Once a doctor is ready to see a patient, the patient with the most urgent priority (i.e. with the lowest number rating) is seen first. However, this class has more general purpose abstraction class. Therefore, it works more generally for many types of priority queues.
